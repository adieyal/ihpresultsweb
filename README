backup_template: This is how the application's built-in backup process 
works. It creates a new directory copying backup_template (which just 
contains a README file), adds the application code and the sqlite database, 
and turns it into a tarball. This may become obsolete at some point, but for 
now I'm leaving it here. The backup script itself is now scripts/backup.sh.

ihp: the Django application, inherited from Adi.

passenger_wsgi.py: Adi needs this for his own deployment process, it might 
go away if the hosting arrangements change.

public: static media files that are neither Wordpress nor Django, e.g. the 
site's favicon.

ihp/settings_prod.py: This script can be deleted once hosting arrnagements change.

ihp/scripts/check.sh: This script will be deleted by March 2011 as there will no longer be a need to collect submissions via email
