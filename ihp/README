1. Log into dabble db and add a country to the IHP:Countries category
2. Then for each agency that is active in that country, add that country to their list in IHP:Agency
3. Run python manage.py loadagencycountries to load the updated data in the application (the cronjob does it automatically but running the command preempts it)
